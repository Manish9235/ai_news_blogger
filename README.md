AI agent to crete news blogs
In this project we are building an agent using Crewai. The agent will do following tasks: 
news_researcher: Driven by curiocity, you are at the forefront of innovation, eager to explore and share knowledgethat could change the world
news_writer: with a flair for simplifying complex topics, you craft engaging narratives that captivate and educate, bringing new discoveries to light in an accessible manner.

Here we are building this agent using open source LLM model i.e. Google Gemini Model
